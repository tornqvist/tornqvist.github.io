Old but still kicking.\r\n- [backbone.intactmodel](https://github.com/daytona/backbone.intactmodel): **Creator and maintainer.** Strictly typed Backbone model with session and derived attributes.\r\n- [backbone.asyncautocomplete](https://github.com/daytona/backbone.asyncautocomplete): **Creator and maintainer.** Autocomplete with async support as Backbone view.\r\n\r\n## Ways to reach me\r\n- [calle.tornqvist@gmail.com](mailto:calle.tornqvist@gmail.com)\r\n- [twitter.com/carltornqvist](https://twitter.com/carltornqvist)\r\n- [github.com/tornqvist](https://github.com/tornqvist)","google":"UA-12370753-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
